    "text":'<h2>The plane that won a war and polluted a river</h2><p>Almost 7,000 B-17s were built during the war years at Boeing&rsquo;s Plant 2 in Seattle. Acres of thrumming machinery, crowds of workers and smokestacks lining the bank of the Duwamish River.</p><p>Seattle&rsquo;s economy was driven mostly by salmon and timber until the war. Plant 2 employed 30,000 people. Nearly half were women. Many were black.</p><p>The plant was demolished in 2010. Today the Duwamish is so polluted that the resident fish are too contaminated to eat. The river was sacrificed for the growth of Seattle.</p><p>Shawn Blocker leads the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Superfund cleanup efforts at this site. He says the evidence was at the bottom of the river.</p><p>As workers made the metal airplane parts the pieces would get dirty, covered in lubricants and greases. The parts had to be dipped in swimming-pool-sized tanks of solvents. Over the years the tanks leaked metals, cancer-causing PCBs and solvents into the river.</p><p>At the time, Boeing wasn&rsquo;t breaking any laws. It would be 30 years before the Clean Water Act or Clean Air Act were created.</p><p>&ldquo;You had a choice,&rdquo; Blocker says. &ldquo;You could worry about being environmentally friendly &mdash; [a concept] which didn&rsquo;t exist then, because that&rsquo;s what everybody did &mdash; or, am I going to build a bomber to help win a war?&rdquo;</p>'

    'text':'<h2>Cleaning up Seattle&rsquo;s urban river</h2><p>During the war years, after parts were machined for the planes they&rsquo;d be covered in gunk and grease. Workers would dip the metal parts in swimming pool-sized concrete tanks of solvents to clean them off. Over the years the tanks leaked toxic metals and PCBs into the river sediment, making fish and other resident shellfish unsafe to eat. </p><p>By the mid 20th century, the river was a hub of industry with a variety of industries contributing pollution to the river. Because of the industrial contamination, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the lower five miles of the river a Superfund site. The cleanup has a pricetag of more than $300 million that could take close to 20 years to complete.</p><p>This historical aerial shot shows the Boeing Plant 2 on the Duwamish River in South Seattle, which Boeing disguised to protect it from being bombed.</p><div class="img-wrapper"><img src="images/b17/X1228.jpg" style="width:100%;"></div>'

    'static':'<h2>Women build warplanes</h2><p>Tens of thousands of workers were needed to build the B-17 bombers at Boeing&rsquo;s plant in Seattle. With most of the young, white men overseas, Boeing had to expand its hiring criteria. They hired more than 12,000 women, and the iconic image of Rosie the Riveter was born. But that iconic image is missing part of the story &mdash; the fact that many of those women were African American. During the war years, African Americans came from all over the South to work in shipyards in Washington and Oregon and to build B-17s in Seattle.</p><p>Listen to an interview with one of those workers. Josie Dunn worked for Boeing for almost 40 years, starting at 62 1/2 cents an hour. She died on Nov. 26, 2016, a few days before this interview was published</p><audio id="audio-player" controls><source src="images/b17/Boeing_woman_Short_Interview_AA.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>',

    'static':'<h2>Rivers power the war effort</h2><p>Columbia River hydroelectric dams powered WWII-era shipbuilders and smelters that made aluminum for Boeing&rsquo;s B-17. Nationally, dams generated enough power to make nearly 70,000 airplanes and 5,000 ships and tanks during the war. Hydropower rose in the post-war industrial boom. Today the West Coast generates most of the country&rsquo;s hydropower.</p>',
