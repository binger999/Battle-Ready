    "text":'<h2>Portland&rsquo;s toxic graveyard for World War II ships</h2><p>A rusty chunk of metal juts out of the riverbank on Portland&rsquo;s South Waterfront.</p><p>It was once part of a Navy ship that helped win World War II. It&rsquo;s one of the few signs left from what was once the country&rsquo;s biggest shipbreaking operation. </p><p>It brought Portland jobs, prosperity and a colossal scrap-metal eyesore seeping with toxic pollution.</p><p>During the war Portland&rsquo;s waterfront launched a new warship every four days. Shipyards all over the country were just as busy.</p><p>After the war there wasn&rsquo;t much use for all those ships. Emery Zidell saw a chance to build on his father&rsquo;s used machinery business. Hundreds of warships came back to Portland &mdash; their toxic contents scattered along the riverbank. </p><p>When Jay Zidell took over the family shipbreaking business, he inherited a polluted wasteland.</p><p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s changed a lot since my dad was young and active and growing the business,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We now know there were materials on the ships that represent environmental issues: lead-based paint and asbestos, PCBs.&rdquo;</p><p>Rather than walk away, the Zidells stepped up to take it on. Now, most of the debris is gone. A thick layer of clean sand, dirt and gravel has been layered over contaminated soil and river sediment. More than 1,500 native plants grow along the riverbank. </p><p>The project took 20 years and more than $20 million.</p><p>And now, the Zidells have a 30 acres of prime riverfront property and a vision for the post-industrial neighborhood they want to see there in the future.</p>'
