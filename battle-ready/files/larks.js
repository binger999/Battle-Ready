    "text":'<h2>The military&rsquo;s surprising role in protecting endangered species</h2><p>More than 400 threatened or endangered species live on military lands. That&rsquo;s almost four times more than in national parks.</p><p>But can wildlife coexist with exploding shells and whirring chopper blades? Biologist Adrian Wolf is working on it.</p><p>On a typical day at Joint Base Lewis-McChord you might find him searching for nesting birds camouflaged in the grass that covers some of the Northwest&rsquo;s last remaining prairie land. He spots one, puts a band on its leg, and takes note of its location.</p><p>Only 2,000 streaked horned larks are left. That&rsquo;s a fraction of their population before the prairies were plowed into farmland and developed into cities and suburbs.</p><p>For Army Lt. Col. J.D. Williams, a typical day on the JBLM prairie involves soldiers, explosive booms, and shells that fly six miles into the air.</p><p>&ldquo;We need space so that I can shoot something,&rdquo; Williams says, &ldquo;and I can observe it and make those soldiers better artillery men.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead of obliterating the endangered birds, the soldiers work them into their training. Biologists provide nest-location coordinates and gunners treat them like hospitals or schools they would avoid targeting in battle.</p><p>Wolf says JBLM&rsquo;s existence has actually defended the endangered larks&rsquo; vanishing prairies from development.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the irony,&rdquo; Wolf says. &ldquo;These military bases are the last refuges of fantastic habitat that is left around the country.&rdquo;</p>'
