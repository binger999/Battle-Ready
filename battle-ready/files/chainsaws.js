    "text":'<h2>A war and the chainsaw&rsquo;s debut</h2><p>Paul Skirvin milked a lot of cows during the war.</p><p>He was too young to enlist, so he spent World War II helping run his father&rsquo;s dairy outside of Portland. Soon after the war ended Skirvin and his brother were hired to log off their neighbor&rsquo;s land.</p><p>&ldquo;We milked those cows all month and made about the same as we&rsquo;d make in a week logging,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That was the end of the dairy.&rdquo;</p><p>They became loggers just in time for the arrival of a wondrous tool, pushed into their hands by World War II.</p><p>The war drove the military&rsquo;s demand for lumber to build hangars, barracks, bridges and crates. And fast. At the request of the military, a small Wisconsin company called Mercury used a revolutionary new model of chainsaw obtained from the wartime enemy, Germany, to design a saw of its own.</p><p>Paul Skirvin remembers when the one-man chainsaw started showing up at home.</p><p>&ldquo;After you got a power saw, man, you just zipped a lot faster. Ten, five, eight times faster,&rdquo; Skirvin says.</p><p>Wartime demand for timber was quickly eclipsed by what came next: the suburban construction boom.</p><p>The Northwest&rsquo;s comparatively untapped forests answered the call.</p><p>The University of Oregon&rsquo;s Steven Beda has studied the postwar history of the timber industry.</p><p>&ldquo;If you live in a house made in the 1950s, 1960s, I can almost guarantee that it is Washington and Oregon lumber that built that house,&rdquo; he says.</p>'

    'static':'<h2>Post-war boom spurs chainsaw innovation</h2><p>From its introduction in the late 1940s, it didnâ€™t take long for the one-man chainsaw to dominate the industry. Smaller and lighter models emerged even as the cutting power increased. Using the saws became easier and more efficient. German chainsaw manufacturing powerhouse Stihl was joined by U.S. and Canadian companies such as McCulloch (California), IEL (Vancouver, BC) and Titan (Seattle) in pushing the evolution. </p>',
