00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.780
This is a gallon.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.380
And this is nuclear waste.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.360
And this is 56 million gallons of nuclear waste.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.620
It’s toxic, radioactive, and is sitting in old, leaky tanks, just a few hours upriver from Portland.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.160
It’s here, at Hanford.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.540
Where all that waste is polluting groundwater...

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.540
...which is seeping toward the Columbia River.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.400
And after more than 20 years and $19 billion spent,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.300
none of it has been treated.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.180
For decades, Hanford was America’s plutonium factory.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.680
It was one of the original Manhattan Project sites,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.540
supplying the radioactive material at the heart of America’s nuclear arsenal.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.440
Over the course of Hanford’s military lifetime, it was home to nine nuclear reactors,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.240
used to irradiate uranium fuel rods creating plutonium.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.260
That plutonium was then extracted with chemicals, processed and shipped off to weapons factories.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.260
Each step of that process produced radioactive waste.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.680
Some of it liquid, some of it solid, some of it somewhere in between.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.200
For decades workers poured much of the liquid waste

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
hundreds of billions of gallons worth

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.040
into the ground.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.880
They dumped the rest 
including solids and sludges

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.160
into underground tanks to be dealt with later.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.400
And now, it's later.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.400
A patch of contaminated groundwater 
the size of Seattle

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.780
lies under the site.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.780
Those old tanks are deteriorating

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
And the official plan to clean it all up

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780
has serious problems.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.420
The basic idea is to pump up and 
treat the groundwater,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420
get the waste out of the tanks,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.680
And process it into glass logs.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560
The first big problem is that radioactive

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.560
waste can generate flammable gasses,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.320
which can build up in the tanks and 
treatment facilies

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
and if ignited...

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.660
On top of that, some of the waste in the tanks

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.940
still contains plutonium, which is heavy.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.220
And as the waste is moved around

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.640
the plutonium could settle out, clump together

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.020
and start an uncontrolled chain reaction.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.020
That might not be such a big deal

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.020
if workers could monitor and step in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.240
to prevent the accident.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.340
But the treatment process

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340
at least for the most hazardous waste

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
has to happen in special rooms

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.340
called black cells

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.340
that are too radioactive for humans to enter.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.340
According to the official plan, the machinery

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.620
in those black cells has to work smoothly

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.460
for 40 years

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
with no direct human intervention.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.720
If something goes wrong, there would be little

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720
workers could do to prevent hazardous

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.020
waste from spreading around the site.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500
But the clean up has made some progress.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.020
The liquid in the oldest, leakiest tanks

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.020
was transferred to newer tanks.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300
And in 2015, workers treated

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.620
2 billion gallons of groundwater.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520
But the vast majority of contaminated

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.140
groundwater is still there.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.800
And they haven't even started treating

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.640
the actual waste in the tanks.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
In fact they haven't even finished building

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.100
the treatment plants.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.640
Construction was supposed to be done by 2007.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640
That slipped to 2011,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640
then 2019.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640
And recently the deadline was extended again

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.500
to 2036 for the most dangerous waste.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Humans have never cleaned up a mess

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
quite like the waste at Hanford.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040
And after years of delays,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.420
we don't know if the current plan will be 
up to the task.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.060
That means that without 
some breakthrough technology

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.740
or new plan,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.060
those 56 million gallons of nuclear waste

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.340
will likely continue to sit just hours

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340
upriver from Portland.
