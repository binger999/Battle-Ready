00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.100
There’s a culture of silence that’s part of Hanford’s history.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.360
It’s a well-kept and in-plain-sight secret.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.540
I got a whiff of something real strong.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.500
It takes your breath away right away.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.560
So I get up in the morning, and I’m stuck in this house most of the time, and don’t know what to do.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.140
I was 22.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.960
I took the test and I got hired on out there.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.020
I thought it was the greatest thing ever.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.660
The place that people in the area worked that did well, I got a job at.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.780
I was really proud that I was a part of it.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.000
At Hanford, Washington, another impossible project proved possible.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.200
The Hanford Nuclear Site was established in World War II to make plutonium.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.580
Then Hanford was used to make even more plutonium for Cold War uses.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.260
It made enough plutonium for tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, the arsenal of the United States.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.540
High level nuclear waste is left over from the process of making plutonium,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.720
and that’s what we’re storing right now, at the Hanford Site.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.500
Cleaning up the largest collection of radioactive waste in the country, has turned Bomb Town into a boomtown.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.360
Cleanup officially started in 1989.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.040
We’ve got 56 million gallons of this waste in about 170 underground nuclear waste tanks.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.660
They’re monitoring the tanks at all times.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.220
It’s radioactive, and there’s thousands of chemicals associated with this waste.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.260
So the workers are on the front line.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.660
They’re a population that’s most at-risk during this cleanup.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.900
They basically diagnosed it as chronic solvent encephalopathy - toxic poisoning in his brain.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.600
He was maybe at the level of a four-year-old.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.380
He had lucid moments where he knew he was losing his mind,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.060
and those were really hard to take.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.400
No person should have to go through that.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.000
The fact that it’s still going on today, after Gary’s died from it...

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.320
...is unacceptable.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.840
It was kind of first documented as far as we could tell back in the late 1980s.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.520
The workers were breathing in toxic vapors and chemicals

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.740
emitted from these tanks into the environment.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.840
Then in 1992 a series of reports were issued by both the Department of Energy and independent federal agencies.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.020
Their own expert panel pointed out that the Department of Energy needs better protection for these workers.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.220
This is pointed out to them in their own expert reports, over and over again.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.320
There is a higher rate of cancer and illness among these workers.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.340
Sometimes they lose a good part of their lung capacity, or it could be mental, neurological brain damage.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.180
Two years later, more exposures, and more studies.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.040
Even though hundreds of people have suffered exposures, it continues.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.260
So please welcome a determined fighter for workers, our Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.100
I feel the federal government has had more than enough time to get this right.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.120
They have failed, and I won’t stand for it.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.340
There is no case we have in my office where the stakes are higher,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.540
that’s the way I look at it, my team knows that, I think about this case every single day.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.520
My office filed a lawsuit to get the courts to step in and require the federal government to act.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.780
They don’t have a warning system in place that is nearly sufficient

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.920
to alert workers at the site when vapors are being released.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.140
There's protective gear the workers can wear.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.880
They need to have a consistent approach from that standpoint as well.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.700
I get that there are workers who may be reluctant to speak about what’s going on.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.380
Please consider talking to us.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:39.120
It just breaks my heart to hear the stories that they tell and hear them say that DOE does not believe them.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.960
As far as I’m concerned - that is bullshit.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:54.300
I recently got accepted for toxic encephalopathy after fighting them for 12 and a half years.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.120
I guarantee you they were hoping that I’d die.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.020
I’m hacking because I can’t breath. This is what happens.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.720
Every morning, every afternoon, every evening, this is what I depend on to live.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.280
And it’s not just me, a lot of us depend on this to live.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.180
And I look healthy, I look OK, and so do a lot of other sick workers, but this is what you don’t see,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.040
when we’re doing this at home, so I thought it was important to show everybody. This is our life.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.160
In my view there is a culture of indifference to worker safety there.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.680
What other conclusion can there be?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.260
I help support Hanford, and I really have been around the Hanford ranch for a very long time.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.760
Overall, the safety record, the industrial safety record, for all these Hanford contractors is very good.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.400
The tanks… each one has different mixtures within it.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:22.360
You get a wide variety of smells but monitors that they have out there say it’s all within standards for inhalation.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.380
So we fight with the U.S. Department of Energy to come forward and say:

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.940
Yes these chemicals are out there and yes we’ll accept that this disease was caused by these exposures.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:53.180
I’ll get files, and I’ll research the files and look for things that are there that can help them.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.900
You feel like you’re constantly having to justify yourself.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.980
The truth.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.480
I want the truth.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.200
They say it’s all in your head.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.900
They will not admit that it happened.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.840
I do think that some of them are for very much for real, it’s a real issue, it’s a real problem.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.660
But it’s a little bit like if one person smells something, then you start smelling,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.260
more carefully as well and the chances are you’re going to smell something too.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.580
It could be that they’re smelling something else.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.180
It happened to me, I know what it was.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.700
People don’t believe.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.520
I’m going to walk to the other side.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.220
That’s where I am going to be at, I told people to meet me, so we’ll see how many people show up.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.900
I don’t want this to happen to anyone else you know?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.480
I’m going to wear my mask since that’s my life anyway.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.380
I don’t want anybody to end up like this.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.720
But we don’t talk about that stuff.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.040
I think it’s time.
