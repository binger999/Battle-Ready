00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.580
When you think about the Pacific

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.830
Northwest you think of lush forests and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.680
pristine rivers but there's a hidden

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.390
history that's left a lasting

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.590
environmental legacy.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.289
This story began 75 years ago.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.759
December 7, 1941.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.940
A date which will live in infamy.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.260
On the homefront America turned to its

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.780
natural resources and industry to arm

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.879
what Roosevelt called an "arsenal of democracy."

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.989
At Bonneville, half a million kilowatts

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
to serve the new war plants.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.839
In the northwestern-most corner,

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.030
a struggling aviation company

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.909
called Boeing stepped up.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.190
In huge Boeing plants out of tough metal

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.590
they forge Americaâ€™s fighting bomber.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.880
Boeing's revolutionary B-17 flying fortress

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.770
would change the course of World War II.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.000
In a matter of months thousands of these bombers

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.020
blackened the skies over France and Germany.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.380
The firepower of a dozen or more

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.020
high rate 50-caliber machine guns.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.000
A bomb-load of three-and-a-half tons.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.180
The B-17 was called the plane that won the war.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.700
Most of them were built in Seattle.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.100
Here they are, Americans at work.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.620
Housewives and farmers, mechanics and teachers.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.780
All races and all creeds, young and old a like.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.899
Each contributes to the building of the bomber

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.729
that has been called the backbone of the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.269
American air offensive.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:51.089
Thirty thousand Boeing workers 
churning out 15 planes a day

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:53.360
But like most manufacturing of that era

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.920
environmental impacts weren't top-of-mind.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.739
Pollution from factories poured into

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.959
nearby rivers and streams contributing

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.789
to environmental problems we're still

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.370
dealing with today.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.780
While Boeing has made strides rehabbing

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.460
Seattle's Duwamish River,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.180
the waterway remains a superfund site.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.460
Cleanup is far from complete.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.880
Seattle was not the only place to pay

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.920
the environmental cost of war.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.360
Throughout the Northwest,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.420
war preparations were underway.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
Timber was logged for airplane 
hangars and troop barracks.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.220
Portland turned out warships by the hundreds.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.060
And in Hanford, Washington

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.020
they helped make the atomic bomb that

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.540
destroyed Nagasaki and brought an end to the war.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.260
No one worried about the environmental

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.610
toll these efforts would take.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.260
Victory was the priority.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.800
And now 75 years later, we're still living with the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.120
environmental consequences of becoming

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.640
Battle Ready.
