00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.580
The Olympic Peninsula in Western Washington is home to some of the last temperate rainforest in the world.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.100
It's often called the quietest place in the country.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.000
It’s better therapy for me than anything else I’ve really been through.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.420
Charles Nelson has been struggling with anxiety and depression for years.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.300
He was diagnosed after he returned home from serving the U.S. Army in Kuwait and Somalia.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.480
The hyper vigilance would kick in, driving in traffic was a problem, the reaction to noises.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
To escape the noise, he takes weekly hikes deep into the rainforest,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.900
with a group of veterans dealing with similar issues.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.420
The biggest turning point for me was to get grounded, to get reconnected,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.440
to feel in an absolutely safe place.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.920
Now, Nelson's quiet sanctuary may be disappearing.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.820
That's because the Olympic Peninsula is becoming a new military training ground.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.580
For a very loud jet.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
Squadrons of Growler jets are based about a hundred miles away, at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.640
This is where everything starts.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.200
Captain Scott Farr oversees the U.S. Navy's Growler fleet.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.840
I'm in charge of all the EA-18G Growlers in the U.S. Navy's inventory.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.800
His unit specializes in electronic warfare.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.760
They use the growler to disrupt enemy radars and scramble threatening electronic signals,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.060
allowing U.S. troops to carry out missions undetected.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.600
Today, Farr is preparing to teach a new class of pilots how to identify and disrupt the right signals.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.060
It takes a lot of very complex training to develop that skill.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.380
The problem is, Farr says his training options aren't complex enough.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.420
So the naval base proposed a new plan.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.380
It calls for putting mobile trucks on forest roads on the Olympic Peninsula.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.780
The trucks transmit electronic frequencies, and trainees practice homing in on the right signals.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.160
Then the trucks move to a different part of the forest.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.220
We have to have mobile emitters that can move around.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.060
Right now we have a single sight based here on Whidbey Island.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.880
If you take a test and you know where the answer is all the time, it doesn't make for a very challenging test.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.420
Trucks hiding on the forest floor will mean more Growlers overhead.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.540
Whidbey pilots have been flying over the Olympic Peninsula since World War II.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.340
But base officials say more residents began taking notice after the Growler was introduced in 2008.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.760
Whidbey Island Naval Air Station welcomed its first EA-18G Growler fighter jet Tuesday.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.800
The Growler replaces the Prowler and there is quite a difference between the two planes.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.120
Nelson noticed a difference, too.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.460
Here we are out seeking healing in this beautiful place and it was interrupted by the absolute

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.800
epitome of what I’ve been trying to avoid.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.760
The electronic warfare range is one of many military training activities under consideration for remote parts of Western Washington.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.720
The Navy recently renewed permits for sonar and explosives testing in the waters off the Pacific Northwest Coast.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.960
Another plan will allow Navy Seals to train on public beaches.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.440
Meanwhile, the U.S. Army proposed helicopter training in wilderness areas in the North Cascades.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.680
The military's presence in the Northwest has been growing as bases shut down elsewhere.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.680
Additional forces were redeployed to the state of Washington, and they were moved to the State of

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.540
Washington because of our geographic and strategic significance.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.140
The Department of Defense has been shifting resources to the West Coast,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.980
in part to protect trade routes with Pacific Rim countries like China and South Korea.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:39.060
We are hours closer by air and days closer by sea for getting to places throughout the Pacific.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.400
Washington State also has ideal training ground. That's becoming more rare.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.040
Training ranges themselves are endangered throughout our country, just because of population encroachment.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.820
As the Northwest's military and civilian populations grow,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.700
they'll be more likely to cross paths in region's quiet places.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.480
I’m not anti military, I’m not anti Navy at all.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.900
My whole point is convince me that it has to be done here.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.600
The U.S. Forest Service recently approved the plan, allowing growlers fly here five days a week, 12 hours a day.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.940
Base officials say that's only a 10 percent increase.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.080
Nelson says any increase is too much.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.900
He knows first hand how difficult it is to restore peace and quiet once it's lost.
