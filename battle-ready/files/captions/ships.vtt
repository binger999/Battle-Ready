00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.780
Today, Portland's South Waterfront has all the amenities of a modern city neighborhood.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.460
Ah ah! Here we go.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.540
It’s right here.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.720
But if you look closely, you can still see traces of a dirty, industrial past.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.780
This has been here since the late 40s or 50s or 60s.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.000
I don’t know when this was tossed over here.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.340
This chunk of metal came from the hull of a warship -

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.640
one of many left to rust on the banks of the Willamette River.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.600
I notice here there’s a big shackle.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720
Paul Fishman spent years digging through the toxic mess.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.480
In the late 40s through the 50s and 60s we didn’t have environmental laws.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.540
They didn’t know this stuff is full of PCB and that could cause cancer. They didn’t know that.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.840
Right here, this is a firebrick from a ship’s boiler.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.480
This was here. We kind of left it. Why pull it all out and put different rocks in there? Let's just leave this.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.920
In an engineering sense it works.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.500
It also says to people there was something else here historically. I wonder what it was.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.000
During World War II shipyards were the pride of Portland.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.960
At their peak, they were launching a new ship every four days.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.500
Some would boast they were building ships faster than Hitler could sink 'em.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.180
President Roosevelt told Americans these ships would bring liberty to Europe.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.740
He called for a seven-day work week to build these liberty ships even faster to win the war.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.680
While we are proud of what we are doing this is certainly no time to be content.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.040
We must build more cargo ships and still more cargo ships.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.200
As soon as one ship was launched the keel was immediately laid for the next ship on that building way.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.120
Speed was encouraged and many times quality suffered.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.100
But these ships were designed to be essentially expendable.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.820
If the United States got two trips of cargo across to support the troops, it was a job well done.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.540
After the war was over, the victory ships were obsolete.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.540
But they still had value as scrap metal.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.100
Emery Zidell turned one of Portland's wartime ship-building sites into the nation's largest ship-breaking operation.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.160
But the ship-breaking wouldn't go nearly as fast as the ship-building.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.560
For decades, the Zidell dock on Portland's South Waterfront was full of warships waiting to be cut up and sold for scrap.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.780
Mounds and mounds and mounds of metal.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:54.600
Just one heap after the next. It was very rusty and gritty, and you kind of go who would want to go out there?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.520
From 1946 through the 1970s, the business dismantled around 300 ships.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.600
I remember dad would come home and say we could go on a particular ship before they started to dismantle it.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.320
They had that kind of rusty smell.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.380
There’s certain smells you sort of can’t forget.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.520
Bill Gobel started working in the scrapyard in 1960, when he was just 16 years old.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.380
So these pieces, they came off the ships when we were in the dismantling days.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.700
Stern pieces, that’s a bow piece there.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.360
Some ship hulls were filled with concrete for ballast.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.300
Those pieces, and anything else that didn't have scrap value, were left on the banks of the river.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.260
At the very end of it, you’d have everything cut down to the last five or six feet of the ship.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.620
That’s what these would be.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.860
The company stopped dismantling ships in the late 70s,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.840
but the process of cutting up ships left a lot more than metal and concrete behind.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.540
When Jay Zidell took over the business from his father, he inherited a polluted wasteland.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.620
The world’s changed a lot since my dad was young and active and growing the business.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.700
We now know that there were materials on the ships that represent environmental issues:

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.940
Lead-based paint and asbestos, PCBs and other things we ran across,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.700
but at the time they were doing it nobody knew that they were hazardous.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.520
The pollution covered 30 acres of land and half a mile of riverbank.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.740
Reviving the site would be a massive undertaking.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.820
This is certainly the biggest project I’ve ever done.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.360
Zidell hired Fishman, an environmental consultant, to oversee a voluntary cleanup.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.220
I said: Guys, I will do this, but I'm only going to work half- time

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.820
because I need the other half-time to see a therapist to figure out why I am saying yes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.320
This riverbank before we started was very steep –

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.600
covered with all kinds of rubble, concrete, asphalt, metal,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.960
all kinds of industrial and urban debris that had been dumped here.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.000
It was truly a mess.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.420
Cleaning it all up meant clearing debris and removing the most contaminated soil and river sediment.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.420
They covered the land and a portion of the riverbed with a tick layer of clean sand, dirt, and gravel.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.680
This entire property now is capped.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.380
So there’s a protective barrier of at least two feet of clean material between people, wildlife, fish, et cetera.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.760
So we’ve cut off the source of contamination.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.420
Then they started planting.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.100
It’s really a whole ecosystem that we’ve —

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.160
I don't like to use the word restored because it's not the way it was 200-300 years ago and beyond,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.020
but it’s really a simulation of a very native riverbank, and we’re very proud of it. It looks great.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.840
By cleaning up an ecological mess, the Zidell family redeemed their own tainted land.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.240
It took 20 years and $20 million dollars.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.220
But now, they have a clean piece of riverfront property and the chance to be part of Portland's

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.220
next chapter of reinvention and redevelopment.
