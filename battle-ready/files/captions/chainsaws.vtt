00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640
The chainsaw...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.800
the most iconic modern symbol of logging.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.940
But it wasn’t always the case.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.160
For a century in the Northwest,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.480
men in the woods labored with axes and hand saws, launching a massive industry.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.320
The timber brought capital, the timber brought a transportation network.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080
Timber brought people.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.200
The beginning of the Northwest as a region had everything to do with timber.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.400
But cutting and preparing trees for transport to the mills was slow, needing large crews.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.960
As demand grew, companies quickly cut through all the easy to access forests.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.940
Timber bosses looked to innovation to move deeper into the woods and speed up the cut.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.820
But it took a great war to push the iconic chainsaw into the hands of the Northwest logger.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.100
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin:

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.500
The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii by air, President Roosevelt has just announced.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.620
The war and the chainsaw set the industry up for the largest timber harvest in modern US history.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.740
Timber was a major commodity of war.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.000
Wood was needed for every aspect of the war effort:

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.100
For airplanes and hangars,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.960
barracks and buildings,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.140
trucks,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.300
bridges,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.840
warships and barges,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.560
and shipping crates.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.020
The acute need for wood prompted the United States to exempt loggers from the draft.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.580
A timber industry workforce that was decimated by the Great Depression suddenly had more work than it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.580
could handle - but still some of the most clunky and rudimentary tools available to get the job done.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.240
At Wayne Sutton’s Chainsaw Museum the entire history of the saw is on display.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.200
If you are talking the chainsaws prior to the War,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.240
you would be some place where they had typically an electric machine.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.180
They had big generators mounted on crawlers or tractors of some sort,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.420
and the chords were the size of a garden hose.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020
These were two-man monstrosities.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.460
And there was some hesitation on the part of loggers to take them on.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.880
One of the things they complained about is the noise,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.460
that the early chainsaws were loud, they were nasty, they spit oil, they spit gas.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.960
But the war helped change that mentality.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.000
And those people that went into the war, the young guys came off farms, they had been working with horses.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.500
Many of them with very little knowledge of equipment and machines.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.280
But when the war came along they were exposed to other kinds of equipment,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.740
beyond what their wildest dreams were.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.840
Some men were even given chainsaws to use in in the war effort -

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.260
clearing paths through European and Asian forests for troops and equipment.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.200
At the request of the military,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.780
a small Wisconsin company called Mercury built that saw using a German saw as a model.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.600
They went into civilian market as soon as the war was over, and he sold piles of them.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.420
The technology and manufacturing capacity was improving because of the war effort.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.940
The two-man chainsaws were giving way to lighter one-man versions thanks to the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.980
development of aluminum and magnesium alloys – strong, light materials.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.320
But the fact that a chainsaw now becomes a lot cheaper and a lot more easy to manufacture has

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.940
to do with this new industrial infrastructure created as a consequence of the war.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.840
With a trained workforce, the chainsaw and other technology,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.280
the timber industry was primed and prepared for the post-war economic boom.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.340
Paul Skirvin had been too young to enlist.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.620
But when World War II ended, he started a logging company that was in business for a half century.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.440
He got his first chainsaw in the late 40s.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.460
Doing it this way you got tired, the sweat rollin’ off too.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.200
After you got a power saw, man, just zip it a lot faster.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.560
Ten, five, eight times faster.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.560
The timber boom was huge in the prosperity that followed the war.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.180
Some businesses are moving to the low rent outskirts,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.460
and so are families, which can afford houses in the country.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.580
They hollered about progress, that they kept building more houses,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.800
you had to keep producing more because they was building more houses.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.920
And the saws come into existence, man, it made you more productive.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.180
You could do a lot more, shorter length of time.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.180
Billions of board feet were being cut from Northwest forests.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.980
If you live in a house made in the 1950s, 1960s,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.080
I can almost guarantee that it is Washington and Oregon lumber that built that house.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.780
Northwest forests have paid an ecological price for the heavy harvest of the post-War era.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.520
Fish and wildlife habitat was decimated.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.260
By the mid-90s, as much as 90 percent of old growth forests were gone.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.340
Now the cut is lower and much more regulated.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.960
As a result, an industry that transformed itself with the chainsaw is once again

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.560
looking to technology to adapt to new environmental expectations.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.260
And there’s still room for newcomers to make their mark.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.040
Matt Hegeberg is the newest generation of logger.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.120
Essentially what we do are the more sensitive and more difficult jobs.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.920
These thinning, restoration, fire treatment jobs are available,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.520
and it’s innovative equipment that makes his business work.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.460
Because we do deal with smaller timber, we aren’t dealing with great, big trees with no limbs on them.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.260
It takes a lot of work to get the volume.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.380
One man can cut a tree down in just a few seconds.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.200
Then it only takes a few more to shear off the limbs and cut it to length.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.780
But still, it’s a man with a chainsaw that’s called in when the ground is too steep,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.640
the brush is too thick, or the ecosystem too fragile for large machines.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.420
It plays a very important role in what we do.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.360
We keep one in every single one of our pickups.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.920
We use them almost daily.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.480
And even today, when logging is more hands-off than ever before,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.720
no self-respecting logger would go to a job site without a chainsaw in tow.
