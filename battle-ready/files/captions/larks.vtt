00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.380
So the nest is just right here.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.880
A baby streaked horned lark.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.460
They look like grumpy little old men.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.940
They never peep at you when you hold them, but it’s just the look that does it.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.060
Only about 2,000 are left on the planet.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.820
Holding these little creatures in my hand is nerve wracking.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.360
It’s... my fingers still shake.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.040
I’m putting the silver band on with this pair of banding pliers.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.120
The colored bands will help identify this lark once it leaves the nest.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.400
That little guy is going to be known as yellow orange white over silver blue.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.180
Adrian Wolf is trying to save these native Northwest songbirds from going extinct.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.680
There he goes.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.900
Good luck, buddy.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.640
You can do it.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.380
But there is danger nearby.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.980
The prairies these larks rely on, happen to be within the Northwest's largest military base.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.760
At Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Western Washington, thousands are learning what it takes to be soldiers.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.780
Training is important. Training increases our readiness, it is our number one priority, all across the army.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.860
Lt. Colonel J.D. Williams commands a battalion of 600.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.760
It's his job to get them ready for deployment.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.660
You can’t just show up to remote locations and expect to know what you’re doing,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.320
you absolutely have to come out into environments like here at JBLM,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.700
and utilize land and train, and perfect your skill, your craft as a soldier.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.160
One of the most difficult skills, William says, is learning to fire heavy artillery.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.880
It takes a battery of nine people, working in careful coordination,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.800
with a remote crew, spotting the target and relaying coordinates.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960
What does an artillery battalion need, we need land.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.680
When we shoot our projectile, it’ll go six miles away.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.080
I need space so I can shoot something and I can observe it, and I can test that system,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.920
and make it better and make those soldiers better artillery men.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.920
Like the soldiers, the larks also need hundreds of open acres.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.480
Once they leave the nest, it's harder for biologists to watch over them.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.140
They are pretty small, smaller than a robin, bigger than a warbler.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.100
They are really cute, the males especially have these little horns, feathers that look like horns.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.300
They don’t actually have horns.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.940
Oh, there he is.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.420
It’s in the scope right now.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.020
Oh, there is another one.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.080
The way that they can hide in just plain sight is amazing.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.440
Even those of us who have been doing it a long time and are very experienced in

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.420
looking for these animals and know that they are out there, still they are very difficult to find.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.240
Streaked horned larks used to be found from British Columbia to Southern Oregon.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.960
But their range has contracted to a few thousand acres.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.180
Well, they’re not doing very well.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.580
They are in decline.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.840
Historical counts where they used to be common and abundant, and they’re not now.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.580
They are really rare.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.120
It's part of Paul Steucke's job to figure out how to train soldiers without killing an endangered species.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.660
We aren’t looking to trade one off versus the other.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.780
I want to make sure that our service members can get their job done,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.620
but that in the process of getting their job done what we have isn't destroyed.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.500
To accomplish this, the base has hired biologists to do conservation work here.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.620
Biologists gather GPS data on nest locations and track young birds when they're most vulnerable.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.800
This will help me remember how many nestlings, how many eggs and what stage they’re all at.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.340
So we are working to identify the locations of the nests and we provide that location information,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.620
in real time, back to the site managers.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.340
Base officials use this data to adjust training missions to accommodate the lark.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.600
They think of the nest locations like hospitals or friendly military units -

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.820
things that soldiers wouldn't want to destroy on a real-life battlefield.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.340
They give us a graphic, and it’s all military overlay, and then we’ll plot it on our map and say "stay out", or "avoid,"

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.540
“make sure you stay here, and don’t even think about coming over here.”

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.280
Okay, that’s great. We’re not going there.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.320
They hold us accountable for the land that we use, and they ensure that we are environmentally sensitive.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.200
And that we didn’t destroy the land, or pollute the environment, or harm any endangered or critical species.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.560
And so, I think it’s exceptional land management, and safe and considerate.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.740
The sprawling military base has actually helped the lark - by defending its prairie from development.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.740
These open training lands provide the habitat because the military is here;

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.180
without the military these would, probably would already be lost.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.600
Prairies were once the dominant landscape in this area.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.040
But in the decades since the base was established in 1917,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.920
the land surrounding the base was taken over by agriculture and then suburban sprawl.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.860
Nearly all that remains of the region's prairie is on the base.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.300
It's become one of the rarest types of landscapes in the United States.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.820
This is the irony. These military bases are the last refuges

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.460
of fantastic habitat that is left in really around the country.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.040
It may seem impossible that larks would be able to coexist with artillery-firing soldiers, helicopters, guns and bombs.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.720
But living in such a dangerous place may in fact be what has protected the streaked horned lark.
