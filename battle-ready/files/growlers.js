    "text":'<h2>Growler jets test rainforest peace as NW military presence grows</h2><p>The Olympic Peninsula was Charles Nelson&rsquo;s best medicine.</p><p>The Army veteran of conflicts in Kuwait and Somalia couldn&rsquo;t cope with daily life when he returned home to Seattle. Then he joined a group of veterans who took weekly hikes into the rainforest.</p><p>&ldquo;It was better therapy for me than anything else,&rdquo; says Nelson, whose diagnosis includes post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Then, without warning in 2013, the rumble of one of the Navy&rsquo;s loudest jets roared over his sanctuary. Nelson defensively somersaulted on the mossy forest floor.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought we were being invaded,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The Navy is seeking permits to send more EA-18G Growlers on training flights over the peninsula from its base on Whidbey Island. Growlers could be flying over the Olympics 260 days a year. The jets disrupt enemy radar and signals so they can&rsquo;t track the movement of troops, planes or missiles.</p><p>&ldquo;We are able to provide sanctuary and a level of safety for our troops no matter what service they&rsquo;re in,&rdquo; says Navy Capt. Scott Farr.</p><p>The noise could be a problem for more than humans. Biologist Jesse Barber has studied ways noise disrupts ecosystems. He lashed noise-emitting speakers to trees throughout a forested stopover for migratory birds. Some birds left and the rest ate less; they were too busy looking for predators.</p><p>The Navy did not consider noise in its environmental assessment of the Growler training.</p><p>&ldquo;It cuts to the heart of the issue: do policymakers use science to make decisions?&rdquo; Barber says. </p>'
