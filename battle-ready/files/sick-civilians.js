    "text":'<h2>Life at a post-war nuclear weapons factory</h2><p>Seth Ellingsworth figured he was set for life. He was 22 and had a job helping clean up one of the biggest environmental disasters in United States history.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was the greatest thing ever,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The place where people in the area worked that did well, I got a job there.&rdquo;</p><p>Ellingsworth is 35 now. He spends most days beset by tremors, struggling for oxygen, confined to his home in Richland, Wash. It&rsquo;s just outside his former place of work: the Hanford Nuclear Site.</p><p>&ldquo;Now it feels like my life is over,&rdquo; says Ellingsworth, who&rsquo;s been diagnosed with reactive airway disease and severe asthma.</p><p>Ellingsworth joins the ranks of workers who have gotten sick while holding down jobs at a facility that stores 56 million gallons of nuclear waste.</p><p>Hanford is the most contaminated former military complex in the country. During World War II and the Cold War, workers here made plutonium. The first Hanford workers armed &ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo; &mdash; the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. For 42 more years, workers armed the United States with nuclear weapons and sometimes risked their own health and safety.</p><p>Now, it has been a quarter-century since the Cold War ended and the cleanup began. But worker advocates say the human toll at Hanford is still rising,  driven by the leftover radioactive waste and what some describe as indifference on the part of the federal agencies that have run Hanford since its covert beginnings.</p>'

While the vents filter small particles and radioactive elements, they don&rsquo;t filter chemical vapors.'
